# RingBell
RingBell is a program that automatically finds and matches a `bell ringer` with a `listener`. The matching process is executed as following:
1. extracting information from `bell ringer`'s application forms
2. match the `bell ringer` with the appropiate registered `listener`
3. establish communication between the `bell ringer` and `listener` on Wechat



Todo list:
- [ ] Implement auto testing feature
- [ ] Hide some info
- [ ] Use mogodb for data
- [ ] Fix config function for command line option (extend it/make it more intuitive)
- [ ] Implement error handling of wrong email input
